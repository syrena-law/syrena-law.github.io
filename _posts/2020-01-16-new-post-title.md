Content for the post.

## Yay.

You can use the _buttons_ above to add **styles**, images or [links](https://thiagohersan.com).

All the crap that it inserts is normal. It's like a simplified html.

For adding a cover image to your post, first add an image to the post:

Now copy the link to the image starting with the img/posts/....

You can delete the image from the post if it doesn't have to be here. A copy of it shows up automatically as the cover.
